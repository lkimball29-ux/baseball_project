We compared their median fastball velocity in the year they got hurt (Red) versus the year prior (Blue).\nKey Takeaway: Look how many Red dots are to the right of the Blue dots. Even as their bodies were breaking down, they were throwing harder."

You’re going to see more injuries.”\n— Max Scherzer, 3x Cy Young Winner\nBy the Numbers\nWe saw a clear correlation between the new pace and the health of pitchers’ elbows."

    "text": "The Question\nIn 2023, Major League Baseball introduced the most radical rule change in the sport’s history: The Pitch Clock.\nThe goal was simple: eliminate dead time and make the game more exciting. By that metric, it was a massive success. Games were shorter, crisper, and more action-packed.\nBut there was a hidden variable. As the pace quickened, pitchers were forced to recover in seconds rather than minutes. Yet, they refused to sacrifice velocity. This project investigates the physiological cost of that decision."
