We compared their median fastball velocity in the year they got hurt (Red) versus the year prior (Blue).\nKey Takeaway: Look how many Red dots are to the right of the Blue dots. Even as their bodies were breaking down, they were throwing harder."

    "text": "The “Gas Tank” Theory We know pitchers were throwing hard in 2023. But could they sustain it?\nPhysiology suggests that with shorter rest periods (15 seconds vs. unlimited), the body’s energy systems cannot fully recharge. If the clock is draining pitchers, we should see velocity drop off faster as the game goes on in 2023 compared to 2022.\nVelocity by Inning (Fastballs Only) The chart below tracks the average 4-Seam Fastball velocity, broken down by inning. We are looking specifically at fastballs to measure raw power output.\nBlue Line (2022): Watch the slope.\nRed Line (2023): Does it dip faster deep into the game?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis What this shows: If the lines are parallel, it means pitchers maintained their effort despite the shorter rest. This supports the theory that injuries are caused by over-exertion rather than just getting tired and slowing down."

    "text": "The Question\nIn 2023, Major League Baseball introduced the most radical rule change in the sport’s history: The Pitch Clock.\nThe goal was simple: eliminate dead time and make the game more exciting. By that metric, it was a massive success. Games were shorter, crisper, and more action-packed.\nBut there was a hidden variable. As the chart above demonstrates, pitchers were forced into a recovery window they had never experienced before. Yet, they refused to sacrifice velocity. This project investigates the physiological cost of that decision."
