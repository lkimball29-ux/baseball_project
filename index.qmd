## The Question

In 2023, Major League Baseball introduced the most radical rule change in the sport's history: **The Pitch Clock**.

The goal was simple: eliminate dead time and make the game more exciting. By that metric, it was a massive success. Games were shorter, crisper, and more action-packed.

**But there was a hidden variable.** As the pace quickened, pitchers were forced to recover in seconds rather than minutes. Yet, they refused to sacrifice velocity. This project investigates the physiological cost of that decision.

## Explore the Analysis

### [**Part 1: The Shift**](clock.qmd)
**How the game changed overnight.**
We visualize the massive reduction in recovery time and the immediate correlation with the rise in elbow injuries.

### [**Part 2: The Red Zone**](velocity.qmd)
**Why didn't they just slow down?**
An interactive deep-dive into specific injured aces (like Jacob deGrom and Felix Bautista) to see how they maintained max velocity even as their bodies reached the breaking point.
